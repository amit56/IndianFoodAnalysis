I LOVE indian food so I decided to use this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/indian-food-101#

I took inspiration from this article and came up with my own new insights: 
https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/indian-cuisine-analysis/

The data consisted of features such as ingredients, cooking time, flavor, region, etc.

The article said West Bengal had the largest proportion of sweet dishes, but what about spicy dishes?  I found out that Punjab, followed by Gujarat, had the most number of spicy dishes.

I found out that non-vegetarian dishes take less time to prep and cook compared to vegetarian dishes, 53 and 67 minutes respectively.  I was expecting the opposite result since I thought meat must be cooked a long time for food safety.

I found out that the most common types of meat eaten were (in order), chicken, fish, prawn, pork, mutton, lobster, duck, and beef.  This makes sense considering religions in India.  For example, strict hinduism forbids beef.

I found out that the states that ate the most fish were Assam and West Bengal, which makes sense because those states border water.  Although I was surprised to not see Kerala, which also borders water.
